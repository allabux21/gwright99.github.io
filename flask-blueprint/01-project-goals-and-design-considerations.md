### Project Goals
By working on this project, I hope to accomplish the following:
1. Settle on a development environment that:
    1. Removes the aggravation of Python development in a Windows environment.
    1. Allows me to work locally but can migrate to the cloud effortlessly.
    
2. Establish a project template that:
    1. Has its dependencies isolated from other projects on the system.
    1. Comes with a pre-configured linting solution.
    1. Comes with a pre-configured testing solution.
    1. Comes with a pre-configured database solution.
    1. Comes with a pre-configured containerization solution (Dockerfile and secret management).
    1. Comes with a pre-configured Github Actions integration (for CI/CD and automatic deployment to a cloud-hosting service).
    1. Comes with the pre-developed capability to respond to browser-based RESTful transactions
  
3. Define the processes and supporting configuration scripts necessary to easily deploy the template into a newly-instantiated local project.
