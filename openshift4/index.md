## Openshift 4 Training
I was recently sent on two Openshift 4 (OCP4) training courses by my employer:
* [DO180 - Introduction to Containers, Kubernetes, and Red Hat Openshift](https://www.redhat.com/en/services/training/do180-introduction-containers-kubernetes-red-hat-openshift
* [DO288 - Red Hat Openshift Development 1: Containerizing Applications](https://www.redhat.com/en/services/training/do288-red-hat-openshift-development-i-containerizing-applications)

To entrench and solidify my understanding of the material that was covered during the courses, I'll be going over the exercises again and documenting steps, gotchas, and notes on why things work a certain way.
