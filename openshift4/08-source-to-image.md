## Source-to-Image (S2I)
Source-to-Image is an OpenShift tool used to create containers based on application source code. The tool collects the source code from a Git repository, injects the source code into a base container that is configured for its programming language, and produces a new container image that runs the assembled application. This is the suggested primary strategy for building applicationns in OpenShift.
