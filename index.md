#### Personal Website & BLog

My name is Graham Wright and I am a Solution Architect based out of Toronto, Canada.

I've created this site to serve as a platform to (1) organize my thoughts and findings as I embark on learning projects to keep my technical skills up-to-date, and (2) to share what I've learned with others who may be grappling with the same problems. 

### Projects
These are the projects I'm working on:
